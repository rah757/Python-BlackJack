# Python BlackJack

## Description

The Python BlackJack project was created during the 11th day of the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) challenge. It's a console-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The game simulates a player competing against a computer dealer.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the Python script.
2. You will be presented with two initial cards for both the computer dealer and yourself.
3. You can choose to continue by typing 'Y' or 'N' when prompted.
4. If you choose to continue, you will draw additional cards.
5. The game keeps track of your total and automatically adjusts the value of Aces (if needed) to keep you in the game.
6. The game ends when you decide not to continue or when you go bust (total exceeds 21).
7. The dealer then draws cards, and the game's outcome is determined.

Enjoy playing Blackjack and test your luck against the computer dealer!
